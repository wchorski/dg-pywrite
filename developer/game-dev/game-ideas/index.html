<p>going of the static script of [[developer/GameDev ðŸ•¹/Dark Room White Tunnel|developer/GameDev ðŸ•¹/Dark Room White Tunnel]]. use <a href="https://twinery.org/" target="_blank" class="external-link">Twine</a> to construct the branching storylines and mechanics of the game</p>
<p>start off as 1 of 4 player<br>
First branch is declining the drug. leave un scathed</p>
<p>If you take the drug you are then propelled into a series of quick time events</p>
<p>If you mess up you black out</p>
<p>The scene starts again with the door opening but now you're a different character. You are presented the same choices with subtle changes in quick time events that throw off the player.</p>
<p>After 2 failed attempts the game clock speed gets faster.</p>
<p>after multiple failed attempts the game loop becomes so fast it's unplayable. Hopefully causing the player to mash or hold buttons to quit the game.</p>
<p>Quick time events</p>
<p>Your character comes incredibly small and you try not to get stepped on by others</p>
