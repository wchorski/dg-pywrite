<p>On a Windows machine, iTunes likes to have a separate audio routing <em>feature</em>, independent of the System Audio.</p>
<p>Example, I'm playing music out of iTunes with my laptop on my lap (audio coming out of laptop speakers). I go to plug in my headphones via aux chord but the music continues to come out of the built in speakers</p>
<p>One &quot;fix&quot; is to close iTunes and (with the headphones plugged in) start up iTunes again remedying the issue. But that is annoying to do every time you dock, headphone, or unplug your laptop.</p>

<p>settings (ctrl + ,) was set to &quot;Windows Audio Session&quot;. Turns out, the one you probably want is &quot;Direct Sound&quot;, the default Windows Audio Driver.</p>
