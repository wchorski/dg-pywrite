<p>If you've tried the <code>max-height</code> css trick to make smooth height animations, you'll realize that this isn't a one size fits all solution (literally)</p>

<pre><code class="language-tsx">
import {QuestionAnswer} from './QuestionAnswer
'

export default function App() {
  return (
    &lt;div className=&quot;App&quot;&gt;
      
      &lt;QuestionAnswer 
        question={`Sometimes I like to put the punchline first`}
        answer={`A lot of people asked me why the line for drinks is before the line for food, so I explained`}
      /&gt;
      &lt;QuestionAnswer 
        question={`My wife told me to stop acting like a flamingo.`}
        answer={`I had to put my foot down.`}
      /&gt;
      &lt;QuestionAnswer 
        question={`Is your refrigerator running?`}
        answer={`Because if it is, you might want to catch it and tell it to slow down before it gets overworked and burns out, leaving you with a fridge full of spoiled food and a hefty repair bill. And if it's not running, you might want to check if it's even plugged in, or maybe it's just taking a well-deserved break after working tirelessly to keep your food fresh and cold.`}
      /&gt;
      &lt;QuestionAnswer 
        question={`Did you hear about the new restaurant called Karma?`}
        answer={`Well, the concept is that you don't actually order any food - instead, the universe decides what you'll eat based on your past actions. So if you've been kind and generous throughout your life, you might get a delicious steak dinner with all the fixings. But if you've been a total jerk, you might end up with a moldy sandwich and a side of expired milk. Anyway, I decided to give it a try and see what I'd get. When I walked in, I was greeted by a wise-looking waiter who informed me that my meal would be determined by a complex algorithm that takes into account my entire life history. I was a little nervous, but also curious to see what I'd get. So I sat down at a table and waited for my fate to be revealed. \n \n

        As I waited, I couldn't help but think about all the good things I'd done in my life - I'd volunteered at a soup kitchen, I'd donated to charity, I'd even rescued a cat from a tree once. Surely, I thought, the universe would reward me with something truly delicious. But as the minutes ticked by, my confidence started to wane. Maybe I'd done some bad things too - I mean, who hasn't told a little white lie or two? And what about that time I stole a pack of gum from the corner store when I was a kid? Would that count against me? \n \n
        
        Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the waiter returned with my meal. He placed a small plate in front of me, and on it was a single pea. I looked up at him in disbelief. &quot;A pea?&quot; I asked. &quot;That's it?&quot; The waiter nodded gravely. &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; he said. &quot;But according to our algorithm, this is all you deserve.&quot; I was incredulous. &quot;But how is that possible?&quot; I asked. &quot;I've done so many good things in my life!&quot; The waiter sighed. &quot;I'm afraid it's not just about the good things you've done,&quot; he said. &quot;It's also about the bad things. And according to our records, you once spent an entire evening watching cat videos instead of finishing a work project that was due the next day. That, my friend, is why you only get a pea.&quot;`}
      /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

<p>You can see I use <code>answers</code> (in this case punchlines from jokes) with varying lengths to show that this dynamically reacts to the content's height and not just arbitrary large number.</p>
