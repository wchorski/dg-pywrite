rough morning for Will. Not because of the late night, but because of his demanding fan thirsting for more **CONTENT**

Peanut butter banana English muffin and a cup of mud to start day. This cold air has us thinking of visiting a NET specialist. 
### 10:30am
A few morning setbacks cut into the skiers' daylight.

Warm + cold weather turns snow to water, water to ice. This makes the walk up to the base more Treacherous then all the downhill action.

### Post Hill R&R 
Emma and Pix provide a relaxing post ski session. [Mango Cart Wheat Ale](https://www.goldenroad.la/mango-cart) in hand, venison sausage on deck (thanks to Frank Balistreri expert bow hunting)

Pho and Chipotle Queso back at Northstar lodge. Learned that [Chipotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipotle) isn't a name of a chili pepper, but dried smoked jalapeños. Later that night Will & Matt host a gathering

Staying on the pepper trend, the cocktail tonight; Jalapeños Cucumber tequila
