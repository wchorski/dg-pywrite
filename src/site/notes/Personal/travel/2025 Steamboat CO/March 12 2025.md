Today's meet up was much more organized and prompt. Just needed a few days to settle in. Gondola ride up the mountain with the 3 musketeers.

### Sunny Lodge Entourage
The snow is icy and unforgiving. A few stops at [Rendezvous Lodge](https://www.steamboat.com/things-to-do/dining/rendezvous-food-court) for a bite and to wait for the sun to soften up the ground. Our snack bags expanded by the low atmospheric pressure.

A Packers jersey passes by. Overhearing the conversation...

> "Nice jersey! You know I lived out in Wisco for a few years"

*I swear these cheese heads are impossible to avoid*

### The return to home base
Will's walk off the hill was accompanied by a dog and her owner. `Penga` woofs an agressive greeting towards me. 

> Well I guess I should say hello back
> - Will

After a few pets the owner laughs and hands Will a treat to give to the new furry friend. Who has who trained? 

### Another QuikTrip
Margaritas and salsa after party at Balistreri's. Starting to like this post ski routine. 

Back at Northstar Condos Matt is busy at work. Steak sliders frying in the pan, petite potatoes roasting in the oven.

### Gamers gonna game
Cuomo's bring dice. A game that +8 people can play called "Wanger" (don't bother googling it, these Cuomo's only know ubscure card/dice games). Unfortunate name, yet still fun to play. Think Yahtzee but not as frustrating. Will takes the victory, beginners luck had nothin' to do with it.

A smooth transition to the next game, a `Bugger` classic, [Ship Captain Crew](https://bargames101.com/how-to-play-ship-captain-crew-dice-game/). Bobby claims this gold medal.

With a fresh pack of cards table side it was inevitable. Cards so new they slid on the table like air hockey pucks. Oh-Heck round 2. This time the players are not playing nice. Many sets, tempers tested. 

Pix crushes the competition with her Aâ™£

One more sit by the fire for Emma and Will
