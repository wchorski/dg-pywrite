Leftover steak, potatoes, and onions for breakfast. Fried in the same greasey pan used last night.

*Thank goodness for HDR*
### Back to The Base
An optimistic 9:30am gondola ride up is stifled by wrong ski polls. ðŸ¤¦

> [!note] Note to self
> Use stickers, marker, paint, or tape to customize your gear. We can't all be using the same grayish/black/blue/white. It's **CONFUSING** 

Ski poll delivery (thanks Steve) and another ride up the gondola.

> "I heard a gondola broke and fell off at that resort" 
> - fellow rider

Comforting words on our ride up

### I Spy
Many texts and calls back and forth, attempting to coordinate a meet up. An incredible eye from Steve and Mary from the chair. 

> "Meet us at 4 Point Lodge!"
> - they yelled from the chair

Gearing up after the break reveals an unfortunate situation. These bindings have seen better days.

### chairlift confessions
Another chairlift mate (local resident originally from Chicago) Tells a morbid story of an unfortunate skiers being taken by the mountain. Why do we *continue* to ride? A question I cannot answer.

The sun playfully dances with the clouds. Bright light + overcast makes for intense snow blind conditions. The ground looking like one big blob of white. 

> just feel the vibe. Just go with the flow man

### Victory Road
Scarlet red chairs line the long hand rail. The Stars align, the gang is all here.

A quick glance at the rack ðŸ™„

### 1 shot, 1 beer
A well deserved rest back at the condo. A bit of stretching, a bit of boob tube. 

Matt (Mr. Stormwatch) breaks the news. 

> We're leaving for home this evening.
> - Matt

Not exactly the news you want to hear midway through a Pacifico ðŸ˜’

During the pack a discovery is made. A rouge Heath Klondike bar tucked away in the freezer. Will snags it for the pity party trip back home.

Overnight in our old stomping grounds [North Platte, NE](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NVBg5hC7kPkzcP2WA). 1am means we didn't get to enjoy the night life. *Ba-hum-bug*
