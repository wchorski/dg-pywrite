York Hyatt Continental Breakfast fuels the next day of road rage. A decident York, NE red velvet waffle with a thick layer of whip cream. No need an IHOP. 

We past our previous stay in North Platte Nebraska and waved as we passed the infamous Capone's Restaurant.

A cruise was an even split between Will & Matt as they get another fill of gas in an unmarked fisherman's town just outside of Laramie, Wyoming. We smash some McDouble's (no cheese) and went on our way.

### Steamboat, CO NorthStar Lodging
Matt tests the Telluride's off road capabilities as we enter the lot. The pile of rocks lining the curb expertly re-arranged.

Phoning in Cuomo/Balistreri, they're hosting dinner, you don't even have to ask you know it's gonna be **good**

Matt & Will start their walk over and that's when *panic* sets in. A wild detour turns what should have been a 5min walk into a half hour. 

### What's for Dinner
Cold, scared, and starving Matt & Will let themselves in the open door of Balistreri.

A savory aroma fills the air
1. Chopped salad 
2. Parm & Basil tossed pasta
3. "Mary Me Chicken" chicken breasts bathed in butter and garlic

Some would say it was a meal of butter and garlic with a *side* of chicken ;)
### Wholesome Oh Heck
To close out the night a game of cards was an order. 

Praise be, there was a lot of cooperation. Everyone scored over 100 points. Elizabeth takes the win, Bob takes the silver.
