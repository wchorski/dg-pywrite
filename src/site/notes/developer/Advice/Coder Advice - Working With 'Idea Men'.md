If in the case you do decide to pick up a project from people like this, give them what they're asking for: A splash page click funnel contact form website. Make it glossy and stamped with their Logo. That immediately peaks interest without having to burn hours of software building. 

## Stage #2
Get them to 'build out' their data structure and features in some sort of flow chart or spreadsheet. If they can't even manage this step, they aren't really business minded people, just some kids that likes to hear themselves talk.
