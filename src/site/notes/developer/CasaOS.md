I tried [CasaOS - A simple, easy-to-use, elegant open-source personal cloud system](https://casaos.io/) as a turn key solution to run a handful of self hosted apps located in a family member's network. 

## My Thoughts
Initially, it has a pretty UI and all the basic needs I'd want in a n00b friendly [[developer/Home Lab 🏠/Home Lab 🏠\|Home Lab 🏠]]. The `App Store` has some essential apps, but is a bit lacking. Luckily all **CasaOS** is is a [[developer/Home Lab 🏠/Docker\|Docker]] wrapper (similar to [[developer/Home Lab 🏠/portainer\|portainer]]). 

Speaking of which, it automatically creates a shortcut on the dashboard when I go spin up a container, even from the command line.   

I like how it's not actually an **Operating System** but an app installed onto a vanilla [[Debian\|Debian]] distro. That way I can install other apps and tools in tandem.
