According to the URL encoding standard (RFC 3986), the following characters are generally safe and do not need to be encoded:

1. Letters `(A-Z, a-z)`
2. Numbers `(0-9)`
3. Hyphen `-`
4. Underscore `_`
5. Period `(.)`
6. Tilde `(~)`

These characters are often referred to as "unreserved characters" in the context of URL encoding. They can be used as-is in a URL without the need for encoding.
