when I need to make a **One to One** copy of a directory, internally or to another machine via a [[developer/Home Lab 🏠/SAMBA\|developer/Home Lab 🏠/SAMBA]] share. I originally used this exclusively until I found [[developer/Home Lab 🏠/Duplicati\|developer/Home Lab 🏠/Duplicati]]

> check out how I sync my iTunes playlists with my [[developer/Home Lab 🏠/Jellyfin\|developer/Home Lab 🏠/Jellyfin]] server

## setup
- run the sync script manually once you point directories
- you can either fire off the sync script via a **Windows Schedule** or **Bash Script** 
- use their [RealTimeSync](https://freefilesync.org/manual.php?topic=realtimesync) version if you need something that **watches** a directory 

### connections
- iTunes
- [[developer/Home Lab 🏠/Jellyfin\|developer/Home Lab 🏠/Jellyfin]]
