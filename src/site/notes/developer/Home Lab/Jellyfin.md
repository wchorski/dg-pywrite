> [!info] [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) The Free Software Media System.
> Jellyfin is the volunteer-built media solution that puts _you_ in control of your media. Stream to any device from your own server, with no strings attached. Your media, your server, your way.

I use this exclusively for music hosting because [[developer/Home Lab/Plex.tv\|Plex.tv]] has more restrictions on client music playback. Plus, with a little shell magic -> [[developer/Home Lab/Jellyfin#iTunes playlist Sync\|iTunes playlist Sync]]

## Phone Players
Gotta be honest, the native [Jellyfin | F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.jellyfin.mobile/) app is very lack luster. 🫰that this will improve in the future. Here is 2 alternatives

1. [Symfonium](https://www.symfonium.app/): It cost **$5**, and that's fine because it is very feature rich (Android Auto, auto sync, Offline downloads, etc). 
2. [FinAmp](https://github.com/jmshrv/finamp)If you're looking for something light weight (and [[developer/FOSS\|FOSS]])

## iTunes playlist Sync
- copy files to server: [[developer/Home Lab/FreeFileSync\|FreeFileSync]] or [[developer/Linux/rsync\|rsync]]
- [[developer/Media Software/iTunes XML Playlist to m3u Converter\|iTunes XML Playlist to m3u Converter]]
- [[developer/MacOs/Apple Music Batch Playlist Export\|Apple Music Batch Playlist Export]]
