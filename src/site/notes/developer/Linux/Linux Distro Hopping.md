Every time I've used a Linux distro, I would always start from scratch or manually move the few `~/` files that would be in my home folder.

It takes a bit of confidence to up and move from one distro to the other without the fear of loosing all the configuration tweaking and apps that you've built on the current machine

## Backup Current Machine

## Copy App List

## Install new Distro
- update before migration
## Migrate
- copy over home folder and configs
