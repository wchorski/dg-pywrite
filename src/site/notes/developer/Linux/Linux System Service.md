Letâ€™s create a file called ` /etc/systemd/system/rot13.service`
```shell
[Unit]
Description=ROT13 demo service
After=network.target
StartLimitIntervalSec=0
[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=1
User=centos
ExecStart=/usr/bin/env php /path/to/server.php

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

set your actual username after `User=`
set the proper path to your script in `ExecStart=`
Thatâ€™s it. We can now start the service:

```shell
systemctl start rot13
```

And automatically get it to start on boot:

```shell
systemctl enable rot13
```
