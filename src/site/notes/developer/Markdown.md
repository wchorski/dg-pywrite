## tips & tricks

converting markdown to HTML like in my [[developer/Projects/Obsidian Publish with NextJS\|Obsidian Publish with NextJS]] project doesn't respect single line breaks unless you give it 2 spaces at the end of the line

Use two or more spaces   <-- 2 or more spaces
to create a line break.
```
