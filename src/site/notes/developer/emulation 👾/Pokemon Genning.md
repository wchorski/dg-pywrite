genning a legal, proper Pok√©mon includes knowledge of what moves a Pok√©mon can get and when, knowing proper EV and IV spreads (Hidden Powers are a thing), and giving them the correct abilities.

I like playing Pok√©mon, but I'm not a fan of grinding my Pok√©mon to perfection to have some chance in PvP Online

I built the app from source as that was the version compatible for Pok√©mon Ranch

## Pok√©mon Ranch
The reason why I got into genning Pok√©mon. I was inspired to save and edit the save file of My Pok√©mon Ranch game (Played with [[developer/emulation üëæ/Dolphin Emu\|developer/emulation üëæ/Dolphin Emu]]). I wanted to be able to add whatever Pok√©mon with whatever nickname, without having to pain stakingly catching and transferring from a Dimond or Pearl game
