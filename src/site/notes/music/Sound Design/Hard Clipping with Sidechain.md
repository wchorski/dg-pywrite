## Scenario 
Every time a **sub** plays the top **lead** becomes distorted for that "blown out" sound. 

1. put compressor onto **lead** synth
2. make that compressor's sidechain input come from the sub
3. make attack, decay, ratio very harsh and flat
4. bring down the threshold so it just shaves off the top of the **lead** every time the sub is engaged
