Plenty of times have I charged people for services (Musician and or DJ Services), but never have I plainly rented out my gear to a customer for a fee

I'm assuming I'll need to keep these factors in mind
- base cost of equipment 
- length of use (in days)
- insurance 
- premium vs regular products

> Use The 10% Rule. Take the retail price of the equipment you are considering and divide that price by 10, the number you get is likely how much it will cost you to rent it.
