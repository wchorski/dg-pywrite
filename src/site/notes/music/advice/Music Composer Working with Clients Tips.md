2 tips I can give any producer creating music for a client

1. Set up meets and talk about music and build a list of inspiration.

2. in the beginning, create 3-5 short loops that demonstrate instrumentation and tempo. Afterwards you can start developing stronger themes, layers, etc. 

I'd say in  [Venus Theory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eREE8eB7Qvo), he got lucky (although I assume his talent also helped) that the client was happy on the first delivery. So many times I've been told "do what sounds good" before the critiques start pouring in. Finding checkpoints where you're ready to show of your demos is a very useful skill that helps keep the project on track without dumping too much time into the wrong sound.

## Give Meaningful Critiques
- build language around the project. Reuse nouns or verbs that have been defined earlier in the talk as to not confuse 
- USE TIMESTAMPS
- use film terms like cut, over the shoulder, medium, establishing, low angle, etc.

1. What you like.
2. What you don't like.
3. What's missing.
4. What doesn't fit.

## Talk about feelings and perspective
- talk about the internal dialouge that may not be audibly expressed in outward dialogue
- talk about how information is revealed and consumed by the audience 
	- example: "I want the musical que to come in later, leaving the audience wondering what is happening 3 seconds in, then chime the music in to confirm / deny those assumtions"
