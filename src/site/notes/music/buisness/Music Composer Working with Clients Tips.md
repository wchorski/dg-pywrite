2 tips I can give any producer creating music for a client

1. Set up meets and talk about music and build a list of inspiration.

2. in the beginning, create 3-5 short loops that demonstrate instrumentation and tempo. Afterwards you can start developing stronger themes, layers, etc. 

I'd say in  [Venus Theory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eREE8eB7Qvo), he got lucky (although I assume his talent also helped) that the client was happy on the first delivery. So many times I've been told "do what sounds good" before the critiques start pouring in. Finding checkpoints where you're ready to show of your demos is a very useful skill that helps keep the project on track without dumping too much time into the wrong sound.
