>  [compositional technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_composition "Musical composition") in more than two [voices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_(music) "Voice (music)"), built on a [subject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_(music) "Subject (music)") (a musical theme) that is introduced at the beginning in [imitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imitation_(music) "Imitation (music)") (repetition at different pitches) and which recurs frequently in the course of the composition. It is not to be confused with a _[fuguing tune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuguing_tune "Fuguing tune")_, which is a style of song popularized by and mostly limited to [early American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_history_of_the_United_States "Music history of the United States") (i.e. [shape note](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_note "Shape note") or "[Sacred Harp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_Harp "Sacred Harp")") music and [West Gallery music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_gallery_music "West gallery music"). A fugue usually has three main sections: an [exposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposition_(music) "Exposition (music)"), a [development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_(music) "Development (music)") and a final entry that contains the return of the subject in the fugue's [tonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonic_(music) "Tonic (music)") key.
