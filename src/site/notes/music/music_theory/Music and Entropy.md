Listening to Benn Jordan's [Wait. Does Music Defy Entropy? ðŸ¤” - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMfVhHxSfDA) video got me thinking about how Entropy can effect a music producer's workflow. 

A better way to phrase the first statement while sounding like some philosopher wannabe could be simply put as 

> "How do we overcome writer's block?"
> - producers everywhere

## Back to the Physics Talk

I we look at the definition of entropy from a physics lens

> thermodynamicsÂ **:**Â a measure of the unavailable energy in a closed thermodynamic system that is also usually considered to be a measure of the system's disorder, that is a property of the system's state, and that varies directly with any reversible change in heat in the system and inversely with the temperature of the system
> broadlyÂ **:**Â the degree of disorder or uncertainty in a system
> - [Entropy Definition & Meaning - Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/entropy)

Simply put, its when the state of some material changes over time, to the point of being nearly impossible to revert back to (on it's own).

## Applying it back to music composition

 That  feeling of getting stuck, spinning the wheels of a composition with the ever growing feeling that you won't be able to get it back to an enjoyable state. And the crystal analogy is what tied this all together. If you think back to how musical ideas are discovered or created, you put yourself at a huge advantage of breeding new seeds to sow. Creating that momentum that you may have lost on a stale project.

This doesn't mean "start over completely" but if you continue to come at a project with the same techniques that you've been using as a crutch, then it's time to change something upstream.
