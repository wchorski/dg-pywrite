> a [virtuoso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtuoso "Virtuoso") piece of music typically for a [keyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_instrument "Keyboard instrument") or [plucked string instrument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plucked_string_instrument "Plucked string instrument") featuring fast-moving, lightly fingered or otherwise virtuosic passages or sections, with or without [imitative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imitation_(music) "Imitation (music)") or [fugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugue "Fugue") interludes, generally emphasizing the dexterity of the performer's fingers. Less frequently, the name is applied to works for multiple instruments (the opening of [Claudio Monteverdi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudio_Monteverdi "Claudio Monteverdi")'s opera _[L'Orfeo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Orfeo "L'Orfeo")_ being a notable example).
