## Question
> Once a friend asked me "If I buy a CD and it gets broken, shouldn't I be able to get a new one paying only the cost of the disc? After all, I have already paid for the "intellectual property included" with my previous purchase". I never thought about it before, but it does make sense....

## Answer
Here is a thought experiment that may poke a hole in this theory. 

Say you bought a wooden dowel with carvings on it. If you broke or lost the dowel you don't go back to the artist with a fresh dowel and expect them to re carve the art on it because "you already purchased the design". 

You may say it's different because we are talking about *digital* media, but when a CD is burned the value is injected onto the disk. Once it leaves the retailer it is now the buyers responsibility to take care of the object. 

That is one plus side to digital downloads. You do get a free backup if ur HDD fails. We will see if digital marketplaces will continue to provide unlimited downloads in the future tho
