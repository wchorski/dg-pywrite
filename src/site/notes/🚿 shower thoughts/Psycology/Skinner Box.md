> The Skinner Box is a chamber, often small, that is used to conduct operant conditioning research with animals. Within this chamber, there is usually a lever or key that an individual animal can operate to obtain a food or water source within the chamber as a reinforcer.
> 
> The chamber is connected to electronic equipment that records the animalâ€™s lever pressing or key pecking, allowing for the precise quantification of behavior.
