>The Liar Paradox is a riddle that has puzzled smart minds for many, many years. Imagine someone makes a statement and then says that their statement is not true. If what they’re saying is actually correct, then it can’t be false. But if it’s false, that would mean they’re actually telling the truth. It’s like a brain teaser that doesn’t have a clear answer. This is known as a paradox, a kind of problem that goes against what we think should happen.
