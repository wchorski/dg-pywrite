> At its core, the “frog” represents the task we find most daunting or unappealing on our daily agenda—the one we’re most likely to postpone or avoid due to its formidable nature. The fundamental message of “swallowing the frog” encourages individuals to confront this challenging task first, setting a productive tone for the remainder of the day.

AKA "Eat the Frog" but I think "Swallow the Frog" sounds more gross, i.e. more in-tune with the idiom's message
